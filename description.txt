--- Pickup Text Configuration ---
commissioned by Giir
developed by GabeHasWon

A simple client-side mod that allows you to modify how and where item pickup text dislpays on the screen.
Three types:
	Screen:
		This shows up somewhere on the screen, much like a UI element.
		The position, scale and display time can be modified to your liking.

	Chat:
		This shows up in the chat. 
		It behaves like any other chat message.

	Off:
		If for some reason this mod is causing issues, this option can fully turn off the mod.
		This can be immediately undone (or redone) in the settings in-game any time.
